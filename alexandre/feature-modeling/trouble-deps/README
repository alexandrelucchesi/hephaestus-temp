THIS FILE DESCRIBES PROBLEMS THAT OCCURED WHEN BUILDING
THE FEATURE MODEL MODULE AND THEIR CORRESPONDING SOLUTIONS.

EDIT IT FREELY (AND PLEASE, DO SO...).

======================================================
funsat:
======================================================
- Cabal file included dependencies whose versions 
were prior to the versions included in the actual 
Haskell Platform. Installing them was not possible 
because it would break other packages ("Cabal Hell").

======================================================
benchpress:
======================================================
- Same as funsat plus the fact it needs a C lib to 
run: 'gmp'. You have to install it by yourself. 
On Mac, simply issuing the command:

    $ brew install gmp

solved the problem. On Ubuntu, a simple apt-get 
should work as well.
